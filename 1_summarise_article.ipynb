He will also appear in \"December Boys,\" an Australian film about four boys who escape an orphanage.\\n\\nEarlier this year, he made his stage debut playing a tortured teenager in Peter Shaffer\\'s \"Equus.\"\\n\\nMeanwhile, he is braced for even closer media scrutiny now that he\\'s legally an adult: \"I just think I\\'m going to be more sort of fair game,\" he told Reuters.
