Or that there are more female college students than male? And did you know the imprisonment rate for men is roughly 15 times higher than the rate for women?\\xc2\\xa0\\n\\nIf this is what boys being easier to raise than girls looks like, coul`d you imagine how many men would be in jail if raising girls got any harder? We worry so much about girls getting hurt -- and justifiably so -- but interestingly enough, the stats show it\\'s our boys who are more likely to get robbed, attacked or even murdered. We see girls as fragile orchids and boys as plastic plants. But let\\'s face it: At the core of this line of thinking isn\\'t safety -- it\\'s sex.\\n\\nWhen someone offers this piece of advice, it\\'s with the thinking that girls have to be protected from boys who will say and do just about anything to get in their pants. What\\'s typically missing from this discussion is the challenge to parents -- particularly fathers -- not to raise a liar and a cheat. \\xc2\\xa0\\n\\nTrue, parents of boys do not\\xc2\\xa0 have to worry about them coming home pregnant, but does that mean an unplanned pregnancy can be considered \"the girl\\'s problem\"? After all, a boy\\'s girlfriend did not get pregnant asexually. That\\'s why I\\'m Tebowing day and night, hoping my 15-year-old has the will to stay away from sex -- even though the world all around him tells him there\\'s something wrong with him if he does.\\xc2\\xa0\\n\\nEasier? Ha. Try different.\\xc2\\xa0\\n\\nA little girl who likes to play sports is called a tomboy. A little boy who doesn\\'t like to play sports is called weird. A teen girl who says \"no\" is called a good girl. A teen boy who says \"no\" is called a sissy. A lot of words describe what it\\'s like for parents who are trying to teach their teenage son how to be his own man in a high school setting that demands conformity, but \"easy\" is not one of them.\\xc2\\xa0\\n\\nI know, I know, \"boys will be boys\" is the accepted rule of thumb. But given that we have a federal department that hunts down and sometimes arrests deadbeat fathers, doesn\\'t that raise the question: What kind of boys are we raising? And if they\\'re dropping out of high school at a faster clip than girls, why do we think raising them is easier?\\n\\nLast year, I wrote a piece with the headline \"Parents, don\\'t dress your girls like tramps.\" I received a lot of e-mails from offended readers who told me I had no idea how hard it was to avoid buying sexy clothing for their little princesses. I usually responded by reminding them I never said it wasn\\'t hard.\\n\\nAnd then I asked if they\\'ve ever seen the words on many of the T-shirts aimed at young men. They may not be blatantly inappropriate, like a cut-off shirt that reveals their bellybuttons, but if I had a dollar for every T-shirt I\\'ve read that sexualizes the words \"balls,\" \"sticks\" or \"size,\" I could retire.\\xc2\\xa0\\n\\nI guess if parents don\\'t care if their son thinks being a man begins and ends with his penis, then yes, I can see how some would think raising a boy is easier. But if you\\'re actually trying to raise a gentleman, and you hear LMFAO rap \"I\\'m running through these hos like Drano\" -- as they do in \"Party Rock Anthem,\" the second most popular song of 2011 -- then you\\'re not breathing a sigh of relief because it\\'s so much easier to raise a boy. Instead you\\'re wondering how much of what you\\'re trying to teach him soaks in, versus what our culture says is OK.\\xc2\\xa0\\n\\nWe\\'ve made so many advances as a society in terms of gender equity, and yet we still hold on to this nonsensical double standard that celebrates sexually active boys while demonizing their female counterparts, as if we can have a lot of one without the other. This kind of thinking is handed down from generation to generation almost as soon as the umbilical cord is cut.\\n\\nBut how can we continue to believe boys are easier to raise than girls, when only 42% of custodial moms received all of their child support payments in 2009? Some see loose women in that statistic. I see some men who are punks.\\xc2\\xa0\\n\\nPerhaps if we stopped viewing raising our boys as easier, we wouldn\\'t have to deal with so many men who still behave like boys later in life. \\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0 \\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\n\\nFollow CNN Opinion on Twitter\\n\\nJoin the conversation on Facebook\\n\\nThe opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of LZ Granderson.q\\x03X\\n\\x00\\x00\\x00highlightsq\\x04]q\\x05(XM\\x00\\x00\\x00When his son was born, people told LZ Granderson it was easier to raise a boyq\\x06XY\\x00\\x00\\x00Boys are more likely to be dropouts and go to jail, he says, less likely to go to collegeq\\x07XS\\x00\\x00\\x00Parents have to fight a culture that encourages boys to be sexually active, he saysq\\x08XR\\x00\\x00\\x00Girls can be tomboys, he writes, but boys are bullied if they aren\\'t \"male\" enoughq\\teu}q\\n(h\\x02X\\xcd\\x19\\x00\\x00(CNN) -- Hackney Wick is nestled next to the Olympic site, separated only by a waterway known as the Lee Navigation. It is a half industrial, half artistic enclave, little known to Londoners, but which has, in recent years, become rich in street art from a cast of artists who have been integral to regenerating east London and informing its cultural identity.\\n\\nWith the Olympics now underway, Hackney Wick can been seen as a microcosm highlighting the forces that street art faces across east London.\\n\\nStreet art meets Locog\\n\\nThe Olympics organizing committee, LOCOG, has been asked to deliver a long-remembered games, and multifaceted legacy for London. This is no easy task.\\n\\nRead more: Why gritty East End is London\\'s gold standard\\n\\nUnfortunately it has failed, overwhelmingly, to engage with London\\'s street artists.\\n\\nIt seems the cultural thinking behind London 2012 is being carried out from within an impenetrable ivory tower, with scant access granted to decision makers.\\n\\nIn essence, there has been a top-down imposition of what LOCOG thinks is the relevant cultural identity of London -- and this has been presented to the world.\\n\\nTo many in east London, where the Olympic Park is located, this imposition feels alien. It feels akin to a form of cultural imperialism, out of synch with the true culture, including street art which may be found just a stone\\'s throw from the Olympic Stadium.\\n\\nMissed opportunities\\n\\nPoliticians and officials talk about London 2012 using words like \"regeneration\" and \"legacy.\" Such aims are a key reason behind London winning the Games, and the ideas are laudable.\\n\\nRead more: London\\'s docks turn into \\'mini Monaco\\' for Olympics\\n\\nBut by not engaging with London\\'s street artists, LOCOG has arguably missed an opportunity to be more culturally relevant and connect with artists who are a real transformative force.\\n\\nFrom a purely cultural standpoint, this is a shame. London boasts some of the finest street art in the world from fresh and exciting artists such as Stik, RUN, Ben Eine, David Walker, Pablo Delgado, Christiaan Nagel and Cityzen Kane.\\n\\nLondon is also a global street art hub, welcoming artists from all over the world. People also come from all over to see London\\'s street art. The diversity and vibrancy of London\\'s street art is staggering, and celebrating this would have shown vision.\\n\\nRead more: The artist who turned Usain Bolt from track legend to street hero\\n\\nPerhaps more importantly, LOCOG\\'s spurning of the street art scene counteracts one of east London\\'s key regenerative forces.\\n\\nStreet art brings energy to the streets and infuses color onto gray and dilapidated walls. Street art has fostered community spirit and made east Londoners proud of where they live too. This is the very thing alchemists within LOCOG are trying to deliver as part of London 2012\\'s legacy.\\n\\nPublic art\\n\\nMany of London\\'s street artists view themselves as servants to their local communities, and maintain close connections with them. They depend on their communities for patronage and support for wall space.\\n\\nAs such, London\\'s street art can be defined as public art for the city\\'s people. Around east London, in particular, the local populace has taken street art to its heart with many locals familiar with each of the different artists at work on the street.\\n\\nToday\\'s generation often work in daylight hours doing legal walls. They are happy to reveal their identities and also to stop and chat with people passing by in the street while they work.\\n\\nIt\\'s sometimes hard for bureaucrats to understand this, so truly ingrained is the media-driven paradigm of all street artists being mischief-makers who put up numerous illegal socio-political stencils in the night.\\n\\nEast London\\'s local councils are, however, actually starting to understand street art\\'s evolving nature and its importance to east London\\'s spirit.\\n\\nLegal pieces are routinely left alone by councils now, and this has largely been the case in Hackney Wick. Pieces still get buffed by over zealous clean up crews but reports of a pre-Olympics war on street art are a little overplayed. The greatest threats to the street art in Hackney Wick are now arguably from companies like Coca-Cola painting over local artists with \"cool\" Olympic themed murals.\\n\\nRead more: Is the Olympics worth more than Google?\\n\\nWhat legacy?\\n\\nStreet art is an important part of east London\\'s identity and a positive force for regeneration. Street art has been dismissed and misunderstood by London bureaucracies in the past, and LOCOG\\'s attitude is no different.\\n\\nHowever we hope it will not always be this way. Changes in attitude and policy will of course take time and by the time the Olympics visits London again perhaps we will be ready. We are seeing encouraging green shoots every day.\\n\\nCNN asked Locog to respond to the opinions expressed by Howard-Griffin. Here is their response:\\n\\nThe London 2012 Festival has 25,000 artists taking part in more than 12,000 events across the UK in the largest cultural celebration every seen in this country.

This is the UK\\'s largest permanent street art project and the biggest urban arts festival in Europe, attracting the world\\'s leading urban artists to converge and create a series of temporary and permanent street art installations and sculpture, including some of the world\\'s largest scale outdoor paintings.\\n\\nFor the first time it will bring together two major international artists, Adrian Utley of Portishead and French artist, Joanie Lemercier of cutting 3D projection experts AntiVJ.

She told CNN that the SBDC works with companies of all types and sizes, including small businesses that would never have the resources to hire a large consulting firm.\\n\\n\"Last week we worked with a lady who was running a dance center for underprivileged kids. As much as she wanted to give away lots of scholarships the school wouldn\\'t exist if she gave so much free service away,\" she said.\\n\\n\"We made a couple of changes to her business, consolidated a couple of classes so teachers didn\\'t have classes with only two students, and increased the fees by $10 a semester which isn\\'t much, but it is when multiplied by many students.\\n\\n\"Now the center can not only teach all the underprivileged kids in that neighborhood and continue to give scholarships, but it also has a plan for sustainability that keeps it in business.\"\\n\\nAt Cambridge University\\'s Judge Business School, part of the MBA program requires students to take part in the Global Consulting Project (GCP). The project sees teams of five MBA students spend three to four weeks offering free consultancy services.\\n\\nMargaret O\\'Neill is projects manager at Judge and says non-profit companies are among those who have benefited from its services. But it\\'s not just small businesses that can see the advantage of student consultants -- Microsoft, Toyota, Procter and Gamble and Shell International have all taken part in the project.\\n\\nO\\'Neill told CNN that companies using the GCP benefit from the students\\' knowledge of up-to-date research methodology gleaned from the course and the fact that students have diverse backgrounds in a variety of disciplines. And with an average age of 32 the students can offer a wealth of experience.\\n\\nAt Temple University\\'s Fox School of Business in Philadelphia, MBA students can participate in the Enterprise Management Consultant Practice (EMCP). The EMCP charges companies $20,000 for a consultancy, but managing director TL Hill estimates this is only a tenth of the commercial going rate.\\n\\nHill says the fee is offered on a sliding scale for non-profits, charities and smaller companies. He gives the example of a project working with a Philadelphia arts program that has created more than 2,000 murals around the city.\\n\\nHill says the MBA consultants helped the arts program think about ways of using its copyrighted artwork images to generate extra revenue, including selling prints and T-shirts featuring the artworks.\\n\\nRobert Parikh is an MBA student at London Business School. Along with seven other students, he forms part of the London Business School (LBS) Consulting Team, a project that runs throughout the summer vacation.\\n\\n\"The idea is to take the skills we\\'re developing and offer them at a reasonable rate,\" Parikh told CNN.\\n\\n\"The people involved with the team often go on to work for the likes of McKinsey and BCG. By hiring us for a short period over this summer our clients will get very high caliber people before they get too expensive.\"\\n\\nParikh points out that the LBS Consulting Team has a strong background in the field. Parikh, 27, has nearly five years of experience as a general manager for BAE Systems, while other team members have worked for IBM, and in real estate and consulting.\\n\\nThe team is run as a business and profits are kept by the students, but money isn\\'t the motivation for Parikh.\\n\\nEach year the project starts from scratch and Parikh hopes that being involved from the start will teach him entrepreneurial skills, as well as providing sales and marketing experience he believes will be useful when he finishes his MBA in 2010 and embarks on his chosen career -- in consultancy.q\\x12h\\x04]q\\x13(XF\\x00\\x00\\x00Some business schools offer student consultancies at affordable pricesq\\x14XI\\x00\\x00\\x00Wharton students have helped 20,000 small businesses in the last 10 yearsq\\x15XD\\x00\\x00\\x00MBA students can combine years of experience with academic knowledgeq\\x16eu}q\\x17(h\\x02X\\x9c\\x10\\x00\\x00(CNN) -- Serena Williams will get the chance to avenge her worst defeat in 16 years on Sunday when she goes head to head with Simona Halep in the WTA Finals finale in Singapore.\\n\\nThe world No. 1 was humbled by the Romanian 6-0 6-2 in the group stages of the tournament earlier in the week, but following Williams\\' semifinal victory over Caroline Wozniacki and Halep\\'s over Agnieszka Radwanska, the pair are set to do battle once more.\\n\\nFew would bet against Williams clinching a third successive title and her fifth overall at the season-ending finals, but Halep will be the fresher of the two women after dispatching her Polish opponent 6-2 6-2.\\n\\nWilliams had to come from a set down to beat Wozniacki in what proved to be a thrilling semifinal on Saturday.\\n\\nAn enthralling match saw the Dane take the first set with ease, 6-2, before Williams rallied to take the second 6-3 to force the match into a decider.\\n\\nWozniacki had only beaten Williams once in their 10 previous meetings, but looked as though she might double her winning tally as the third set headed towards its climax.\\n\\nA break of serve for Wozniacki in the ninth game gave her the opportunity to serve out the match, but Williams, ever the fighter, broke back immediately to level at 5-5.\\n\\nTwo games later it was Wozniacki who was staring down the barrel as Williams earned a match point on the Dane\\'s serve, but the world No. 8 bravely resisted to take the match into a tiebreak.\\n\\nWith a match point saved, Wozniacki then raced to a 4-1 lead in the tiebreak before Williams bounced back with five unanswered points.\\n\\nWozniacki saved a further two match points, before Williams finally clinched the tiebreak 8-6 in a marathon deciding set lasting 76 minutes.\\n\\n\"I have to say Caroline played a great match,\" Williams said afterwards.\\n\\n\"It was really difficult today.

After giving me a quick look, the cab driver asked: \"So where can I take you, Father?\"\\n\\nI had just arrived in Silao, Mexico located in the state of Guanajuato, which has the highest percentage of Catholics in Mexico. Yes, I was wearing a dark suit -- my blue shirt had no collar though -- but the confusion had to do more with the cab driver\\'s sense of anticipation than the way I looked.\\n\\nMore than 3,000 archbishops, bishops, priests and nuns descended on Guanajuato last week with the hope of meeting the head of the Church. Pope Benedict XVI was coming to Mexico for the very first time in his seven-year papacy and the sense of anticipation was great. It was to be the pope\\'s first trip to Spanish-speaking Latin America as well. The country was chosen carefully: Mexico has the second largest population of Catholics in the world, after Brazil.\\n\\nBy the time Benedict arrived at El Bajio Airport Friday afternoon, there were tens of thousands of people lining up the streets along the 20-mile stretch that would take him to Colegio de Miraflores, a Catholic school run by nuns in the city of Leon where the pope would stay three nights.\\n\\nMost greeters were high school students who seemed genuinely excited about the pope\\'s arrival. But others were compelled to attend by schools and church authorities. The City of Leon cancelled classes and declared a holiday.\\n\\nMexico was the first country Pope John Paul II visited in 1979, only months after being elevated to the papacy. Benedict XVI has been pope for seven years and had received two personal invitations from Mexican President Felipe Calderon, who traveled to the Vatican in 2007 and again in May of last year.\\n\\nBefore the visit, many Mexican Catholics perceived Benedict as a distant and reserved pope who felt uneasy when interacting with people -- a perception the Catholic and the Mexican Church were trying to lay to rest.\\n\\nThat probably explains the reason why Benedict wore a broad-brimmed sombrero on arriving at Guanajuato state\\'s Bicentennial Park to celebrate a mass attended by hundreds of thousands. He again wore a sombrero when addressing worshippers congregated outside Colegio de Miraflores on the last night of his visit.\\n\\n\"I\\'ve made a lot of trips, but I\\'ve never been welcomed with such enthusiasm. Now I can understand why Pope John Paul II used to say \\'I feel like I\\'m a Mexican pope\\',\" Benedict told a crowd of thousands of excited followers.\\n\\nAnd then, there were the references to the Virgin of Guadalupe, the patron saint of Mexico. As an academic with deep knowledge of theology and canon law, the pope is probably not thrilled about the fact that some Mexicans put images of the dark-skinned representation of the Virgin Mary right next to that of Christ.\\n\\n\"To love her [the Virgin Mary] is to get committed to listen to her Son; to venerate the Virgin of Guadalupe is to live according to the words of the blessed fruit of her womb,\" the pope reminded people attending the open-air Mass.\\n\\nAt the Mass, the pontiff urged Mexicans to rely on their faith to fight poverty, drug violence and other ills that have afflicted Mexico in recent years. The pope made repeated references to the sorrow of recent violence in Mexico.\\n\\nMexico is only three months away from holding presidential elections and the opposition questioned the timing of the visit. President Calderon\\'s party, the PAN, is Catholic-oriented and deeply conservative. The president appeared with the pope every single day of this visit. That would have been unthinkable before 1992, when Mexico resumed diplomatic relations with the Vatican after a 130-year freeze.\\n\\nAll four presidential candidates attended the pope\\'s main mass at the park.\\n\\nThe only controversy about the visit surfaced Saturday. On the same day Pope Benedict addressed and blessed a group of 1,800 children in Guanajuato, three Mexican authors released a book accusing the Vatican of hiding or ignoring cases of child sex abuse by Roman Catholic priests. The book entitled \"La Voluntad de no Saber\" (Willing not to be Aware), focuses on Father Marcial Maciel, a now-deceased, Mexican-born Roman Catholic priest accused of multiple cases of sexual abuse of minors. Calls for the pope to meet victims of sexual abuse while in Mexico went unanswered.\\n\\nThe big question after the visit is whether Pope Benedict XVI was able to connect with young people.\\n\\nThe Catholic Church has lost a significant number of members in the last few decades. The percentage of Catholics now stands at 83% in a country that used to be almost universally Catholic. Was Pope Benedict able to erase the perception that he is a distant academic or is he now seen as a warm and affectionate, grandfather-like figure, much like his predecessor?

Nearly every domestic terrorism-related prosecution has included the charge as part of the indictment.\\n\\nGroups listed as \"foreign terrorist organizations\" by the State Department include al Qaeda, Hamas and Hezbollah.\\n\\nA federal appeals court in San Francisco, California, struck down several parts of the legislation, finding them too vague to satisfy the Constitution.\\n\\nThe government then asked the high court to intervene and uphold the law.\\n\\nThe key plaintiff in the appeal is the Humanitarian Law Project, a Los Angeles, California-based non-profit that says its mission is to advocate \"for the peaceful resolution of armed conflicts and for worldwide compliance with humanitarian law and human rights law.\"\\n\\nIt sought interaction with the Kurdistan Workers\\' Party, a group active in Turkey. Known as PKK, the party has been labeled a terror organization by the United States and the European Union. Its leaders have called for militancy to create a separate Kurdish state in the parts of Turkey, Iraq, Syria and Iran where Kurds are a majority.\\n\\nIn its appeal to the high court, the government noted that \"since its inception, the organization has waged a violent insurgency that has claimed over 22,000 lives.\"\\n\\nHumanitarian Law Project claimed it wanted to advocate on behalf of the PKK before the U.N. Commission on Human Rights, and conduct other advisory sessions and public awareness campaigns.\\n\\nBreyer, in an unusual step, read a portion of his dissent from the bench. He said the majority wrongly read the law \"to forbid the teaching of any subject where national security concerns conflict with the First Amendment. The Constitution does not allow all such conflicts to be decided in the government\\'s favor.\"\\n\\nBreyer was supported by justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Sonia Sotomayor.\\n\\nThe court\\'s majority opinion was not a complete victory for the government and came with an important caveat. The activity in question can be banned only if \"coordinated with, or controlled by foreign terrorist groups.\" The justices gave no specific guidance on how that distinction should be made. The court also said the law does not extend the ban on material support to domestic groups.\\n\\n\"The government is wrong that the only thing actually at issue in this litigation is conduct,\" said Roberts. \"Plaintiffs want to speak to [certain foreign designated groups] and whether they may do so under [the federal law] depends on what they say. If plaintiffs\\' speech to those groups imparts a \\'specific skill\\' or communicates advice derived from \\'specialized knowledge\\' -- for example, training on the use of international law or advice on petitioning the United Nations -- then it is barred. On the other hand, plaintiffs\\' speech is not barred if it imparts only general or unspecialized knowledge.\"\\n\\nSupreme Court nominee Elena Kagan had argued the administration\\'s case as solicitor general, back in February. That was before she was tapped by President Barack Obama.\\n\\n\"Hezbollah builds bombs,\" she said of the Palestinian militancy group. \"Hezbollah also builds homes. What Congress decided was when you help Hezbollah build homes, you are also helping Hezbollah build bombs. That\\'s the entire theory behind this statute, and it\\'s a reasonable theory.\"\\n\\nRalph Fertig, a 79-year-old civil rights lawyer who founded Humanitarian Law Project 25 years ago, told CNN he feared being arrested if he continued his international outreach efforts with groups designated as terrorists.\\n\\n\"My mission would be to work with these groups, to try and convince them to use peaceful means to resolve these ongoing conflicts,\" he said after the arguments. He filed the lawsuit against the government.\\n\\nThere was no immediate reaction from his group or the government. But human rights groups criticized the ruling.\\n\\n\"The Supreme Court has ruled that human rights advocates, providing training and assistance in the nonviolent resolution of disputes, can be prosecuted as terrorists,\" said David Cole of the Center for Constitutional Rights. \"In the name of fighting terrorism, the court has said that the First Amendment permits Congress to make human rights advocacy and peacemaking a crime. That is wrong.\"\\n\\nThe Patriot Act was passed six weeks after the 9/11 terrorism attacks. It included amending a previous anti-terror law to strengthen the \"expert advice and assistance\" provision, making it a crime punishable by a 10-to-15 year prison sentence.\\n\\nThe case is Holder v.

Gen. Ramadan Mahmoud Ramadan, allegedly gathered his troops and explained their mission. \"Use heavy shooting. Nobody will ask you to explain,\" the brigadier said, according to \"Amjad,\" one of the many defectors I have interviewed in the last months.\\n\\nAmjad explained to me that normally the troops were supposed to save bullets, but this time it was different. \"The commander said to use as many bullets as we wanted.\"\\n\\nOver the next four days, security forces in Daraa killed around 200 people (Human Rights Watch documented the abuses at the time by interviewing victims and witnesses) and arrested thousands, subjecting many to beatings and torture. Since then, Amjad and more than 60 other defectors from Syria\\'s military and intelligence agencies have given us crucial information about who was responsible for abuses across the country. They provided consistent accounts of officers giving similar orders to military units all over Syria, at different times. The orders were to stop the protests \"by all means necessary.\" In many cases, they said, officers gave orders to fire directly at protesters.\\n\\nThe defectors told us that some soldiers reacted by throwing away their weapons and making a run for it. Others aimed above the protesters\\' heads or to the ground. But that was dangerous. Eight defectors told us that they saw officers and intelligence agents killing soldiers who disobeyed orders. Others were detained and tortured. We are not publishing the defectors\\' names and locations to protect them and their families.\\n\\nAll these statements demolish President Bashar al-Assad\\'s claim that the bloodshed is the result of a few rogue commanders getting overly enthusiastic on crowd control. The defectors\\' testimonies paint a horrific picture of a widespread and systematic crackdown against demonstrators: torture, arbitrary arrests and a \"shoot to kill\" policy that clearly amount to crimes against humanity.\\n\\nAl-Assad and his allies have sought to portray the protesters as \"armed gangs sponsored from abroad.\" In more than nine months of investigations in Syria, we have documented episodes of fighting, and attacks on security forces by armed defectors have increased. But the vast majority of protests that we documented were nonviolent, and the government\\'s use of force was clearly excessive compared with any threat facing troops.\\n\\nThe Syrian leadership has so far gotten away with murder, in part because the Russian government, one of Assad\\'s staunchest allies, has blocked action on Syria at the U.N. Security Council and continues to supply Syria with arms. The Syrians whom I interviewed were well aware of Russia\\'s obstructionist position. As Ghassan, a former officer, was serving tea during our interview, he suddenly stopped and looked at me with suspicion. \"I heard you are Russian -- if you say that you support their position on Syria, you won\\'t get any tea!\" He was joking, of course, but his anger at Russia was real.\\n\\nSince Russia blocked Security Council action in October, Syrian security forces have killed more than 2,000 people, according to the U.N. high commissioner for human rights, Navi Pillay. Russia\\'s continued obstruction sends a signal to the Syrian government that it can continue its violent crackdown with impunity.\\n\\nIt is difficult to conduct human rights investigations on Syria, since the government has barred most journalists, human rights monitors and even a U.N. commission of inquiry. But it is not impossible. I managed to enter Syria and speak safely with victims there, and we continue to interview witnesses in neighboring countries. We\\'ve spoken to hundreds of Syrians with firsthand knowledge of abuses. And in a report Human Rights Watch released Thursday, we\\'re naming 74 commanders, from generals to colonels to captains, who allegedly ordered, authorized or condoned the abuses.\\n\\nBut responsibility for these crimes does not stop with the commanders on the ground. Under international criminal law, al-Assad, as commander in chief of all forces in Syria, bears responsibility for the most serious crimes committed by his forces -- even if he did not order them -- to the extent that he knew or should have known about the abuses and failed to prevent them. Given the widespread public and international criticism of the abuses, it would be incredible for al-Assad to argue that he did not know.\\n\\nPillay told the Security Council this week that the death toll in Syria tops 5,000, including 300 children killed. Amjad\\'s commander may have told his troops that \"nobody will ask you to explain,\" but he was wrong.\\n\\nIt\\'s time for the Security Council to act: to impose an arms embargo on Syria, to apply targeted sanctions to al-Assad and his circle of cronies, and, most important, to refer Syria to the International Criminal Court in The Hague. That is where Ramadan, his fellow commanders and his bosses will have to explain themselves and where their many victims will receive justice.\\n\\nThe opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Anna Neistat.q@h\\x04]qA(X]\\x00\\x00\\x00Anna Neistat: Defectors say Syrian military told them to use \"heavy shooting\" in Daraa attackqBXV\\x00\\x00\\x00She says al-Assad must take responsibility for killings, torture reported by defectorsqCX8\\x00\\x00\\x00She says Russia has helped block Security Council actionqDXZ\\x00\\x00\\x00Neistat: Syria must face arms embargo, sanctions, referral to International Criminal CourtqEeue.'"
